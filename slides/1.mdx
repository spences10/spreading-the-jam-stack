# History Lesson

  <p>- This is more scene setting than anything else</p>
  <p>- I'm not going to talk about Sir Tim</p>

## What's a JAMstack? 🤔

- JavaScript
- APIs
- Markup

</Split>


<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- The JAMstack is not about specific technologies.</p>
  <p>- LAMP, MERN, whatever</p>
  <p>- It's more a paradigm of how to deploy</p>
  <p>- a way of building websites and apps that helps deliver:</p>
  <p>- better performance,</p>
  <p>- higher security,</p>
  <p>- lower cost of scaling,</p>
  <p>- and a better developer experience.</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

## JavaScript

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is
    handled by JavaScript,
  </p>
  <p>- running entirely on the client (the browser). </p>
  <p>
    - This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla
    JavaScript.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

## APIs

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted
    into reusable APIs,
  </p>
  <p>- accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.</p>
  <p>- These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

## Markup

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time,</p>
  <p>- usually using a site generator for content sites,</p>
  <p>- or a build tool for web apps.</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

## Also known as Static Sites

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- static site generators, SSGs</p>
  <p>- when you think about static sites what do you think?</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

## Static

- Early 90's

---

# What is static?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- if we look at the dictionary definition</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Static (loaded term)</p>
  <p>- lacking movement, action or change</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# JAMstack

- It's not the experience
- It's the architecture

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- why is that important though?</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- why is that important though?</p>
  <p>- slight tangent now</p>

# Perf

---

# Speed

# 🐢

---

# People want things fast

---

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Perf has been a factor in Google's ranking algorithm since 2010
  </p>
  <p>- That's not news,</p>
  <p>
    - people are using mobile devices a lot more now for everything
  </p>
  <p>- there are two indexes, desktop and mobile</p>
  <p>- perf will affect...</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# How users interact with your site

## _will_ impact rankings

---

# Click through rates

---

# Time spent on page

---

# Return rates

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- returning users</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Bounce Rates & Conversions

## where it _really_ matters

## 💷 💳 💸 🤑

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- emoji here to emphasise the importance</p>
  <p>- so...</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# How fast is fast enough?

---

# 2 seconds ⏱

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- apparently</p>
  <p>- let's take a look at an infographic...</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- this slide is from a think with Google post,</p>
  <p>- on mobile industry benchmarks (from 2018)</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Back to static

---

Static means no work to be done at request time.

###### for the content that's not dynamic

---

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- lets look at an example of how that works</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# _Dynamic_

<div>Browser 👀</div>
<div>⬇</div>
<div>CDN 🌐</div>
<div>⬇</div>
<div>Load balancer ⚖</div>
<div>⬇</div>
<div>Web server 🤹‍♀️</div>
<div>⬇</div>
<div>Database server ‍🤹‍♀️</div>
<div>⬇🔃</div>
<div>Browser 👀</div>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- simplified example</p>
  <p>- Some resources that may be on a CDN</p>
  <p>- Or an origin server that is sitting behind a</p>
  <p>- AWS load balancer,</p>
  <p>- and there'll be logic on there to route the request</p>
  <p>- to one of maybe several web servers</p>
  <p>- Web server for server things</p>
  <p>
    - Then there may be a request for things to render from a database
  </p>
  <p>- then imagine this as a round trip</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# _JAMstack_

<div>Browser 👀</div>
<div>⬇</div>
<div>CDN 🌐</div>
<div>⬇</div>
<div>Browser 👀</div>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- CDN</p>
  <p>- this can be enriched further with the A in the JAMstack</p>
  <p>- The Gatsby team refer to this as the content mesh</p>
  <p>- have your prebuilt site and enrich further with services</p>
  <p>- and micro-services</p>
  <p>- these can be leveraged directly in the browser</p>
  <p>- or at build time</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Empower

## front end developers

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- much smaller stack</p>
  <p>- fewer things for the developer to manage</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Powered

## By modern browsers

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- the capabilities they have</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Enhanced

## By a rich ecosystem of services

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Now.sh, Netlify</p>
  <p>- GraphCMS, Strapi</p>
  <p>- Snipcart, stripe</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Impact

## Processes and organisation

---

# Static Site Generators

## JavaScript

### Gatsby.js

### Next.js

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- I've made it this far without mentioning any frameworks</p>
  <p>- I'm sure I've impressed my team with that!</p>
  <p>- Static site generators aren't new</p>
  <p>- April 2013 for Jekyll</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Gatsby is more of a PWA generator</p>
  <p>- Detail the workflow</p>
  <p>- Netlify with a pre built template</p>
  <p>- Netlify with Gatsby</p>
  <p>- Netlify with this presentation</p>
  <p>- Now.sh with a pre built template</p>
  <p>- Now.sh with Gatsby</p>
  <p>- Now.sh with this presentation</p>
  <p>- Netlify with a pre built template</p>
  <p> - search HTML5 template, pick http://www.initializr.com/</p>
  <p> - download bootstrap version</p>
  <p> - load it to Netlify</p>
  <p> - Mind blown</p>

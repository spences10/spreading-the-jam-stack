  <p>- Who cares?</p>
  <p>- Hopefully by the end you will care more</p>

# JAMstack

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- First up! It's not JAMstack anymore</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Jamstack

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- It's jamstack</p>
  <p>
    - The creator of the term and his company have decided it's
    Jamstack
  </p>
  <p>- Coined back in 2016 by Netlify CEO Matt Billman</p>

    - Which has a lowercase J so as not to give any emphasis I guess.

# What is a Jamstack? üí°

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- We'll come onto this</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# What is the _jam_ in jamstack?

# ü§î

<Split>

# Jamstack ‚ö°

<ul
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'left',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>APIs</li>
  <li>Markup</li>
</ul>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- The holy trinity of web development</p>
  <p>- The Jamstack is not about specific technologies.</p>
  <p>- Like, LAMP, MEAN, MERN, whatever</p>
  <p>- It's more a paradigm of how to deploy</p>
  <p>- a way of building websites and apps that helps deliver:</p>
  <ul>
    <p> - better performance,</p>
    <p> - more secured projects,</p>
    <p> - lower cost of scaling,</p>
  </ul>
  <p>- and MOST IMPORTANTLY a better developer experience.</p>
  <p>
    - I say MOST IMPORTANTLY as a developer, but ultimately it will
    lead to a better user experience.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# JavaScript

<img
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'right',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
  src="/javascript-logo.svg"
/>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is
    handled by JavaScript,
  </p>
  <p>- running entirely on the client (the browser). </p>
  <p>
    - This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla
    JavaScript.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<Split>

# APIs

<img
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'right',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
  src="/database-schema.svg"
/>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted
    into reusable APIs,
  </p>
  <p>- accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.</p>
  <p>
    - These can be custom-built or leveraged third-party services.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

<Split>

# Markup

<HtmlLogo textColor="#f7fafc" />

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time,</p>
  <p>- usually using a site generator for content sites,</p>
  <p>- or a build tool for web apps.</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# AKA Static Sites

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- So, when you think about static sites what do you think?</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

<Split>

# Static

<ul
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'left',

  <li>Neopets</li>
  <li>MySpace</li>
</ul>

<img
  style={{
    width: '70%',

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Remember when a site like this was where it was at?</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<img
  style={{
    width: '70%',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
  src="/capt90s.gif"

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - There's been a nice re-imagination of a a 90s site in the recent
    captain marvel film.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# What is static?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- if we look at the dictionary definition</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

<img
  style={{
    width: '50%',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
  src="/what-is-static.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Static (loaded term)</p>
  <p>- lacking movement, action or change</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Is my project Jamstack?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - pre-rendering, if you pre-render and have your project on a CDN,
    then yes, it's a jamstack project
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# What's not a Jamstack project?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or
    another backend language.
  </p>
  <p>
    - A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views
    on the server at runtime.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - So, a site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal
    or Squarespace is not jamstack
  </p>
  <p>- Back to the Jamstack though</p>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Perf has been a factor in Google's ranking algorithm since 2010
  </p>
  <p>- That's not news,</p>
  <p>
    - people are using mobile devices a lot more now for everything
  </p>
  <p>- there are two indexes, desktop and mobile</p>
  <p>- perf will affect...</p>

# Click through rates

# How fast is fast enough?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- apparently</p>
  <p>- let's take a look at an infographic...</p>

<img
  style={{

  src="/mobile-page-speed.png"

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- this slide is from a think with Google post,</p>
  <p>- on mobile industry benchmarks (from 2018)</p>
  <p>- from 2018 so this has probably decreased</p>
  <p>
    - Just under a third of potential visitors lost after three
    seconds
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Performance matters

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Studies have also shown the negative impact poor performance can
    have on business goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    - For example, the BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users
    for every additional second their site took to load.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# 10% loss of users

for every additional second to load the site

---

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Pinterest reduced perceived wait times by 40% and this increased
    search engine traffic and sign-ups by 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
    - Perceived wait times are achieved by prerendering part of the
    page.
  </p>
  <p>- Search engine traffic and signups increased by **15%**</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<img
  style={{
    width: '15%',

# 15% increase

---

# Back to static

# Perf

No work at request time.

##### for the content that's not dynamic

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Static means</p>
  <p>- No work to be done at request time</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Security

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- lets look at an example of how that works</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

  <p>- and there'll be logic on there to route the request</p>
  <p>- to one of maybe several web servers</p>
  <p>- Web server for server things</p>
  <p>
    - Then there may be a request for things to render from a database

  <p>- this can be enriched further with the A in the Jamstack</p>
  <p>- The Gatsby team refer to this as the content mesh</p>
  <p>- have your prebuilt site and enrich further with services</p>
  <p>- and micro-services</p>
  <p>- these can be leveraged directly in the browser</p>
  <p>- or at build time</p>

# Empower

## front end developers

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- much smaller stack</p>
  <p>- fewer things for the developer to manage</p>

# Powered

## By modern browsers

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- the capabilities they have</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Enhanced

## By a rich ecosystem of services

  <p>- Now.sh, Netlify</p>
  <p>- GraphCMS, Strapi</p>
  <p>- Snipcart, stripe</p>

# Static Site Generators

## JavaScript

### Gatsby.js

### Next.js

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- I've made it this far without mentioning any frameworks</p>
  <p>- I'm sure I've impressed my team with that!</p>
  <p>- Static site generators aren't new</p>
  <p>- April 2013 for Jekyll</p>

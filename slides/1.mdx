# Jamstack

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- It's Jamstack</p>
  <p>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- This is more scene setting than anything else</p>
  <p>- I'm not going to talk about Sir Tim</p>
  <p>

## What's a Jamstack? 🤔

<ul
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'left',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>APIs</li>
  <li>Markup</li>
</ul>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- The holy trinity of web development</p>
  <p>- The Jamstack is not about specific technologies.</p>
  <p>- Like, LAMP, MEAN, MERN, whatever</p>
  <p>- It's more a paradigm of how to deploy</p>
  <p>- a way of building websites and apps that helps deliver:</p>
  <ul>
    <p> - better performance,</p>
    <p> - more secured projects,</p>
    <p> - lower cost of scaling,</p>
  </ul>
  <p>- and MOST IMPORTANTLY a better developer experience.</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# JavaScript

<img
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'right',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
  src="/javascript-logo.svg"
/>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is
    handled by JavaScript,
  </p>
  <p>- running entirely on the client (the browser). </p>
  <p>
    - This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla
    JavaScript.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# APIs

<img
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'right',
    display: 'inline',
  }}
  src="/database-schema.svg"
/>

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted
    into reusable APIs,
  </p>
  <p>- accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.</p>
  <p>
    - These can be custom-built or leveraged third-party services.
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<Split>

# Markup

<HtmlCssLogo textColor="#f7fafc" />

</Split>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time,</p>
  <p>- usually using a site generator for content sites,</p>
  <p>- or a build tool for web apps.</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# AKA Static Sites

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- static site generators, SSGs</p>
  <p>- when you think about static sites what do you think?</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<Split>

# Static

<ul
  style={{
    marginLeft: '20%',
    width: '30%',
    textAlign: 'left',

  <li>Neopets</li>
  <li>MySpace</li>

# What is static?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- if we look at the dictionary definition</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

<img
  style={{

    display: 'inline',

  src="/what-is-static.png"

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Static (loaded term)</p>
  <p>- lacking movement, action or change</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Is my project Jamstack?

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- When is your site not built with the Jamstack?</p>
  <p>- Does it depend on a web server?</p>
  <p>
    - A site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal or
    Squarespace.
  </p>
  <p>
    - A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or
    another backend language.
  </p>
  <p>
    - A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views
    on the server at runtime.
  </p>
  <p>- Back to the Jamstack though</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Perf

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Performance matters</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Speed

# 🐢

# People want things fast

<img
  style={{

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Perf has been a factor in Google's ranking algorithm since 2010
  </p>
  <p>- That's not news,</p>
  <p>
    - people are using mobile devices a lot more now for everything
  </p>
  <p>- there are two indexes, desktop and mobile</p>
  <p>- perf will affect...</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# How users interact with your site

## and it _will_ impact rankings

---

# Click through rates

---

# Time spent on page

---

# Return rates

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- returning users</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Bounce Rates & Conversions

## where it _really_ matters

## 💷 💳 💸 🤑

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- emoji here to emphasise the importance</p>
  <p>- so...</p>

# How fast is fast enough?

# 2 seconds ⏱

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- apparently</p>
  <p>- let's take a look at an infographic...</p>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- this slide is from a think with Google post,</p>
  <p>- on mobile industry benchmarks (from 2018)</p>
  <p>- from 2018 so this has probably decreased</p>
  <p>
    - Just under a third of potential visitors lost after three
    seconds
  </p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Back to static

# Perf

No work at request time.

##### for the content that's not dynamic

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Static means</p>
  <p>- No work to be done at request time</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Security

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- lets look at an example of how that works</p>

</Split>
  
<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- simplified example</p>
  <p>- Some resources that may be on a CDN</p>
  <p>- Or an origin server that is sitting behind a</p>
  <p>- AWS load balancer,</p>
  <p>- and there'll be logic on there to route the request</p>
  <p>- to one of maybe several web servers</p>
  <p>- Web server for server things</p>
  <p>
    - Then there may be a request for things to render from a database
  </p>
  <p>- then imagine this as a round trip</p>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- CDN</p>
  <p>- this can be enriched further with the A in the Jamstack</p>
  <p>- The Gatsby team refer to this as the content mesh</p>
  <p>- have your prebuilt site and enrich further with services</p>
  <p>- and micro-services</p>
  <p>- these can be leveraged directly in the browser</p>
  <p>- or at build time</p>

# Empower

## front end developers

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- much smaller stack</p>
  <p>- fewer things for the developer to manage</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Powered

## By modern browsers

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- the capabilities they have</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Enhanced

## By a rich ecosystem of services

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Now.sh, Netlify</p>
  <p>- GraphCMS, Strapi</p>
  <p>- Snipcart, stripe</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

# Impact

## Processes and organisation

---

# Static Site Generators

## JavaScript

### Gatsby.js

### Next.js

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- I've made it this far without mentioning any frameworks</p>
  <p>- I'm sure I've impressed my team with that!</p>
  <p>- Static site generators aren't new</p>
  <p>- April 2013 for Jekyll</p>

  <p>- Detail the workflow</p>
  <p>- Netlify with a pre built template</p>

  <p> - download bootstrap version</p>
  <p> - load it to Netlify</p>

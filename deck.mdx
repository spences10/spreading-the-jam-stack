# Spreading the JAMstack

## Hello JAMstack

---

export default Split

## What's a JAMstack? 🤔

- JavaScript
- APIs
- Markup

```notes
The JAMstack is not about specific technologies.
It’s a new way of building websites and apps that

delivers better performance,
higher security,
lower cost of scaling,
and a better developer experience.
```

---

## JavaScript

<small>

Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled
by JavaScript, running entirely on the client (the browser).

This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla
JavaScript.

</small>

---

## APIs

<small>

All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into
reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.

These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.

</small>

---

## Markup

<small>

Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a
site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

</small>

## Also known as Static Sites

static site generators, SSGs

- It's not the experience
- It's the architecture

---

What is static?

### Definition

Static (loaded term), static means the architecture not the result,
static means capable of being served directly from a CDN

---

Static means no work to be done at request time.

---

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

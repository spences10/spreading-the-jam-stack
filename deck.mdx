## What's a JAMstack? ü§î

- JavaScript
- APIs
- Markup

```notes
- The JAMstack is not about specific technologies.

- LAMP, MERN, whatever

- It's more a paradigm of how to deploy

- a way of building websites and apps that helps deliver:

- better performance,

- higher security,

- lower cost of scaling,

- and a better developer experience.
```

## JavaScript

<img
  src={require('file-loader!./images/javascript-logo.svg')}
  alt="JavaScript logo"
/>

```notes
- Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled
by JavaScript,

- running entirely on the client (the browser).

- This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla
JavaScript.
```

---

## APIs

<img
  src={require('file-loader!./images/database-schema.svg')}
  alt="database schema"
/>

```notes
- All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into
reusable APIs,

- accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.

- These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.
```

---

export default Split

## Markup

<img
  src={require('file-loader!./images/css-html.svg')}
  alt="html and css logos"
/>

```notes
- Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time,

- usually using a site generator for content sites,

- or a build tool for web apps.
```

# Back to static

---

export default Layout

Static means no work to be done at request time.

###### for the content that's not dynamic

---

export default Layout

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

```notes
- lets look at an example of how that works
```

---

export default Split

# _Dynamic_

```notes
- simplified example

- Some resources that may be on a CDN

- Or an origin server that is sitting behind a

- AWS load balancer,

- and there'll be logic on there to route the request

- to one of maybe several web servers

- Web server for server things

- Then there may be a request for things to render from a database

- then imagine this as a round trip
```

# _JAMstack_

```notes
- CDN

- this can be enriched further with the A in the JAMstack

- The Gatsby team refer to this as the content mesh

- have your prebuilt site and enrich further with services

- and micro-services

- these can be leveraged directly in the browser

- or at build time
```
